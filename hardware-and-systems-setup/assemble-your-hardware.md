# Assemble your hardware

## Inspect your hardware

Inspecting your hardware physically is an important step to remove the possibility of supply chain attacks. This happens when the hardware is somehow compromised (e.g. with a keylogger) before it reaches you.

Open up your node device - the Intel NUC in this case - and make sure there are no unknown components that look badly soldered onto your motherboard (the big green plate). &#x20;

## Assembling your hardware

#### RAM:

* Align the gold plates of your 16GB Lexar DDR4-3200 SODIMM memory chip with each memory slot on the NUC _- starting first from the inner slot -_ and slot it into the slot at a diagonal elevation.&#x20;
* Once the gold plates of the memory chip is snugly slotted in to the memory slot, gently push the memory chip downwards until you hear it "click" into place

#### **Storage:**&#x20;

* Unscrew the small screw near the WIFI chip
* Align the gold plates of your NVME SSD chip with the SSD slot on the NUC and slot it in
* Gently push and hold the SSD chip down and screw the small screw back into its original slot to hold the SSD chip in place. **Note:** You do not have to screw it on too tightly   &#x20;
