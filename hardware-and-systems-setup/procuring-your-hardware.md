# Procuring your hardware

## Key considerations

As a home staker, some of the key considerations you'd have are:&#x20;

1. Space and aesthetic constraints in your home
2. Getting familiar with hardware assembly

The Intel NUC and ASUS Mini PC form factors are recommended here because of these reasons. They have similar compact sizes, sleek black design, in-built cooling system, and a standardised motherboard layout — which are ideal properties for new learners to get up to speed on hardware requirements rapidly.

## Suggested Shopping List&#x20;

_\*Prices in USD_

### **Essentials**

Either builds are good options but the Intel NUC CPU set is slightly more expensive on Amazon. The RAM and storage components are also interchangeable across both builds so it ultimately comes down to which components you are able to get at the cheapest price based on your location (i.e. vendor availability).&#x20;

_\*Actual price of this 4TB SSD might depend on the promotion period. Given that the Dencun upgrade is likely to arrive in a couple of months, it might be good to future-proof your build with a 4TB SSD in exchange for a slight increase in cost._&#x20;

## Cost considerations

1. **Revenue:** A single ETH validator will generate between 4.0% (median) to 5.3% (mean) yield. At ETH price = USD2300 (_28th Jan 2024_), this will give you an income of between USD2944 to USD3900 per year.
2. **Cost:** The minimal hardware cost described here is USD753 and electricity is negligible at around USD90 (SGD120) per year
3. **Payback Period:** \~3 months at median; \~5 months if no block proposals are received

**However, you will be able to run many "vanilla" validator keys, along with multiple liquid staking service on just a single set of hardware** to make your operations more capital efficient — e.g. running with 2 validator keys doubles your revenue without increasing your cost base.

Leveraging on liquid staking services like Diva Staking will allow you to further scale your TVL and income as a solo staker without increasing your capital proportionally.

## Other Considerations

For learners with more advanced knowledge in building home servers, you might want to consider building a device that supports ECC RAM. This will cost slightly more but can potentially save a large amount of troubleshooting time if there is a RAM failure. _**More information around this topic can be found on the Ethdocker resources below:**_&#x20;

{% embed url="https://eth-docker.net/Usage/Hardware/" %}

The trade-offs, however, are that (i) you will likely require a larger form factor and (ii) because ECC RAMs non-consumer components, it might take a few weeks for your vendor to replace (not readily available) your RAM if there is a RAM failure.
