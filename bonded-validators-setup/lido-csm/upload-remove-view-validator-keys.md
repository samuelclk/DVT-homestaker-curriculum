# Upload/Remove/View validator keys

## Upload keys

* Go to the Lido CSM Widget and connect your wallet. <mark style="color:red;">**MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE ON THE CORRECT NETWORK (i.e., Hoodi or Mainnet).**</mark>
  * **Mainnet:** [https://csm.lido.fi/](https://csm.lido.fi/)
  * **Hoodi:** [https://csm.testnet.fi/](https://csm.testnet.fi/)
* Select `Become a Node Operator` and then `Create a Node Operator`
* On the Lido CSM Widget, upload your `deposit data file` and select the corresponding bond type (ETH, stETH, wstETH), and provide the desired bond amount

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Copy & Paste" %}
Print the contents of the `deposit_data.json` file on your node machine, then copy & paste the contents into CSM Widget directly.

* Identify the actual file name of your `deposit_data.json` file on your node

```sh
ls ~/ethstaker_deposit-cli*/validator_keys
```

* **Print the contents:**

```sh
cat ~/ethstaker_deposit-cli*/validator_keys/deposit_data-<timestamp>.json
#replace <timestamp> with the actual numbers in your file name
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Upload File" %}
Transfer the deposit\_data-\<timestamp>.json file from the USB used in the validator key generation step onto your working device (e.g., laptop with Metamask), then upload the file.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* Finally, select `Submit`, sign the transaction with your connected wallet, and you are all set.
* Now you just need to wait for the Lido CSM to deposit your validator keys (using your `deposit data file`). This is a first-in, first-out process so expect a queue when demand is high. More details on this process [here](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module#block-25614a13674b465f875db871081091f9)

{% hint style="info" %}
**DO NOT DEPOSIT 32 ETH** using the deposit data file generated this way as the Lido CSM will make the deposit for you. _**Doing so will result in a loss of funds.**_
{% endhint %}

## Remove keys

The Node Operator can delete uploaded keys voluntarily (e.g., duplicate keys) if it has not been deposited yet.&#x20;

A fee is confiscated from the Node Operator's bond on each deleted key to cover maximal possible operational costs associated with the queue processing. Keys (via the deposit data file) can be deleted in continuous batches (e.g., from index 5 to 10).

More details [here](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module#block-051fceb673504a489e541e3615984084).

* Go to the Lido CSM Widget, under the `KEYS` header
* Select the `REMOVE` tab on the widget
* Select the keys you want to remove--

Once your keys have been removed, the associated bond amounts that you deposited earlier will be available for claiming under the `Bond & Rewards` tab.

Keys that have been deposited cannot be deleted and only can be exited.
{% endhint %}

You can also view the status of the keys pertaining to your uploaded deposit data file and take the necessary actions.
