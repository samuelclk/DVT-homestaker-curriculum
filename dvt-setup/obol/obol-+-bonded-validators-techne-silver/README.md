# Obol + Bonded Validators (Techne Silver)

The Obol Silver Techne Credentials require clusters to be operational on the Ethereum Mainnet. This can be prohibitive because splitting 32 ETH among 7 operators still requires 4.57 ETH per operator.

One good workaround is to combine your Obol setup with one of the bonded validator options available--splitting the reduced collateral amount instead of the full 32 ETH. &#x20;
